## Exercise 1 â€“ Install and Start Apache Cassandra

For Cassandra, I've used docker based cassandra.
1. Download & install docker.                        
2. Install Cassandra through kitematic or through docker commandline.    
3. Start the cassandra docker instance.
4. Connect to cassandra docker shell.
